Have you ever wanted to visit a coffeeshop, but you are not sure if it is any good? Or maybe you are not sure what to order, unsure of which drink is most popular? Well, with The Local Coffeeshop web app, you don’t have to worry about those questions anymore. The Local Coffeeshop will show coffeeshops in your area, and will allow you to look at the average rating on them, the reviews posted by other users, what drinks are popular and allow you to write a review based on your very own visit there. You can also keep track of your favorite coffeeshops, and look at, revise, or delete your reviews. So what are you waiting for? Sign up today!

**What about the process?**

This was a blast to create and overall, I would say creation of it went smoothly. I started out by writing down all the specifications I wanted this app to do. Then I designed the schema of the database, I prefer to use pencil and paper for this process, mainly because I do not own software for such application. I sketched out the main tables, then the join tables. Once I completed the sketches of the schema, I created migrations for all the tables. After that, I tested out all of the model associations and acted out the functionality between all of them in pry. Next I went to create the views and controllers in steps of importance, the application controller, the user controller, the coffeeshop controller and so on…

Once completed, everything functioned according to plan. I look forward to adding styling and more functionality to this when I get the chance.
