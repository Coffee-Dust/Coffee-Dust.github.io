The idea of tic tac toe is quite simple. The idea of AI is not. How will these two things combine?
To start out, I got full feel for TicTacToe, I dug deep into all the possible winning combinations, what it took to get there, what caused a loss and what caused a tie. I took that data and made an AI that no human can beat. It was quite challenging, but at the same time, quite fun. The process involved making my AI think to the future and decide which move to take, a move that will cause it to stop the other player from winning, immediately identifying threats that would cause it to loose and ultimately pulling off a win/tie.

I hope to bring more AI to life in the future.
