I guess I can start from the near beginning. When I was quite young, I always had a facination with computer and how they work, I was always into gaming and I discovered an online sandbox game, where you could program your own game with Lua Scripts. I tried learning Lua but since I was really young and never had programming experince before, I only got a basic understanding of it. So I continued with my school work and didn't really do much programming until high school. During high school I got into a new languege that was released by Apple, it is called Swift. Learning Swift was great! I got a really good under standing of it. My electives in my high school were on programming, and I also learned quite a bit from those classes.

**The 8-bit Master**
When I graduated, I decided to try my hand at creating a game for the App Store. The game idea was to make a virtual handheld gaming console, with virtual buttons, just like the classics had. It would play multiple 8-bit games, although on release, I only had one, it is an asteroids arcade shooter. I plan on updating it to a new version which would add more games, cosmetic features and code improvements sometime when I find the time.
